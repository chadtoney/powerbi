When using JAWS on a Power BI Embedded report, a user cannot interact with the report via keyboard. In order to interact with the embedded report via keyboard, they would need to access the Power BI pop-up menu "Press Ctrl + Enter to interact with the report" then choose "Skip to main content." This pop-up menu cannot be interacted with because it conflicts with JAWS's use of the Ctrl button for muting.

However, I figured out if you tab another time AFTER than menu appears, you can interact with that pop-up menu.
